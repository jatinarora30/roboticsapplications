# Reinforcement Learning Basics for Robotics

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning where an **agent learns by interacting with an environment**.  
In robotics, RL is used to train policies for navigation, manipulation, and decision-making under uncertainty.  
This file introduces the **core ideas and resources** you should know before diving into robotics RL projects.

## 1. Why RL in Robotics?

- Many robotics problems (navigation, control, planning) can be framed as **sequential decision-making**.  
- RL provides a way to **learn from trial and error** instead of hand-coding all behaviors.  
- It bridges **simulation and real-world deployment** through concepts like domain randomization.

## 2. Key Concepts to Review

- **Agent, Environment, State, Action, Reward**  
- **Policy**: a mapping from states to actions.  
- **Value Functions**: measure expected long-term return.  
- **Exploration vs Exploitation**: trying new actions vs sticking to known good ones.  
- **Discount Factor (γ)**: balancing short-term vs long-term rewards.  
- **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**: the mathematical foundation of RL.

## 3. Important Algorithms to Know (Conceptual)

- **Dynamic Programming**: Policy Evaluation, Value Iteration.  
- **Model-Free RL**:
  - Monte Carlo methods.  
  - Temporal Difference Learning (TD, SARSA, Q-learning).  
- **Policy Gradient Methods**:
  - REINFORCE algorithm.  
  - Actor-Critic methods.  
  - Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).  

*(You don’t need to master all of these before the course, but knowing the basics will help a lot.)*

## 4. Robotics-Relevant RL Topics

- **Continuous Action Spaces** (robots don’t just pick “left/right” — they choose velocities, torques, etc.).  
- **Safety in RL** (avoiding unsafe exploration in real robots).  
- **Simulation-to-Real Transfer (Sim2Real)**: training in simulation, deploying in hardware.  
- **Reward Shaping**: designing rewards that encourage desired robot behavior.
