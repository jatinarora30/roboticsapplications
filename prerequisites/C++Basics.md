# C++ Basics for Robotics

C++ is widely used in **robotics and ROS 2** because of its speed and ability to work close to hardware.  
This file will guide you through the **concepts you should know** before diving into robotics applications.

## 1. Why C++ in Robotics?

- Control: Direct access to memory and hardware.  
- Industry standard: Many robotics libraries (ROS 2, MoveIt, OpenCV) are written in C++.

## 2. Essential Topics to Review

- **Basic Syntax**: variables, data types, operators, conditionals, loops.  
- **Functions**: defining, calling, and passing arguments.  
- **Pointers and References**: important for memory and ROS messages.  
- **Classes & Objects**: object-oriented programming, constructors, destructors.  
- **Header Files**: separating declarations and implementations.  
- **Namespaces**: avoid conflicts, especially in ROS packages.  
- **STL (Standard Template Library)**: vectors, maps, queues, iterators.  
- **CMake**: how to compile and link C++ programs (ROS 2 uses CMake).

## 3. Robotics-Relevant Concepts

- **Memory Management**: stack vs heap, new/delete.  
- **Inheritance & Polymorphism**: used in ROS 2 node design.  
- **Templates**: generic programming for reusable robotics code.  
- **Multithreading**: ROS 2 executors often run multiple callbacks.  
- **Exceptions & Error Handling**: making robotics code robust.
