# Python Basics for Robotics

Python is one of the most important languages in robotics because of its **ease of use**, rich libraries, and integration with **ROS 2**.  
This file will guide you through the **concepts and resources** you should review before starting the course.

## 1. Why Python in Robotics?

- Simple syntax → easy to write and debug.  
- Huge ecosystem → libraries for robotics, AI, and data science.  
- ROS 2 support → many nodes and packages are written in Python.  
- Great for prototyping → fast testing before converting to C++.

## 2. Essential Topics to Review

- **Basic Syntax**: variables, data types, operators, conditionals, loops.  
- **Functions**: defining and calling functions.  
- **Modules and Packages**: importing and organizing code.  
- **Data Structures**: lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries.  
- **Classes & Objects**: object-oriented programming.  
- **Error Handling**: try/except for robust robotics code.  
- **File I/O**: reading/writing files (useful for logs, configs).  
- **Virtual Environments**: using `venv` or `conda` to manage packages.

## 3. Robotics-Relevant Concepts

- **Numpy Basics**: arrays, linear algebra, matrix operations.  
- **Matplotlib**: plotting sensor data and results.  
- **Argparse**: handling command-line arguments in robotics scripts.  
- **Threading & Async**: handling multiple processes in robotics applications.  
- **YAML/JSON**: configuration formats used in ROS 2.
